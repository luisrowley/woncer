# Woncer

**Woncer** is a Composer package that serves as a toolbox for [WordPress Nonces](https://codex.wordpress.org/Wordpress_Nonce_Implementation). It aims to provide a developer-friendly API to help you implement the most common functions for creating and validating tokens in a secure way. All the logic has been restructured to follow an Object-Oriented approach that builds upon the original Wordpress functions.
