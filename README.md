# Woncer

**Woncer** is a Composer package that serves as a toolbox for [WordPress Nonces](https://codex.wordpress.org/Wordpress_Nonce_Implementation). It aims to provide a developer-friendly API to help you implement the most common functions for creating and validating tokens in a secure way. All the logic has been restructured to follow an Object-Oriented approach that builds upon the original Wordpress functions.

## How to use

## Running the tests

This project has integrated the PHPUnit system to perform **unit tests** for all class methods on an individual basis. By employing this procedure, it guarantees that the resulting code is solid and secure, regardless the input values that you feed the functions with.
