# Changelog

## 0.0.2 (2019-12-23)

**Fixed bugs:**

1. Inheritance: Fixed the "decoupling" problem between the `WPNonceChecker` (nonce validation class) and its parent class `WPNonce` (main nonce class definition).

2. In the previous version, all the Nonce creation logic was centralized in the `WPNonce` class, which made the structure very rigid and was lacking modularity.

3. No code (or documentation) existed to fetch and initialize a nonce from request data.

4. The interface structure needed to be redefined to better reflect the new classes.


**Implemented enhancements:**

1. Instead of building a parent/child relationship between these two classes (`WPNonce` and `WPNonceChecker`), a better solution was to implement a "top-level" abstract class called `WPNonceAbstract` with the main Nonce definition. This abstract class will be implemented by any of the classes which may need a basic Nonce definition to properly work, but without limiting the extending classes from providing an alternative Nonce implementation if necessary.

2. The solution was to implement a separate class for each different context: `WPNonceCreator` for a default context, `WPNonceURLCreator` to add the nonce as a URL parameter and `WPNonceFieldCreator` to append the nonce as a form field.

3. New logic was created in `ContextRequester` class to verify the Nonce context based on HTTP request. This can be implemented both by Nonce "Creator" classes and by the Nonce "Checker" class.

4. A new interface definition was placed on top of `WPNonceAbstract` to comply with the structural requirements for a basic Nonce implementation.
